# TestudoScraper
 
The TestudoScraper is a Python script that checks the availability of seats in specific courses on the University of Maryland's Testudo course search page. The script scrapes the webpage for the specified course and sends an email notification when seats become available for the preferred instructors. The reason this is helpful is because instead of having to log in every hour to check the status of open seats, you can simply sit back and check your phone for an email!
